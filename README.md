# FermionsUI
A lightweight CSS library that helps UI/UX designers and front-end engineers develop web pages quickly.

## Estimated target:
1. Integrate most of the mainstream CSS frameworks on the market, such as: Bootstrap, CoreUI, Foundation, Font Awesome and others (expected).
1. Make a set of Figma and Adobe XD files based on FermionsUI, so that UI designers and front-end engineers can achieve the effect that the design draft is the finished product.
1. Using the modular system, you can use only FermionsUI. You can also choose to match Bootstrap or other CSS development frameworks. Load modules as needed.
1. Update the latest CSS and JS features at any time, and you must enable the experimental function to enable it.
1. Compatible with almost all browsers, including Internet Explorer and Safari.
1. Highly customizable anything.
1. Support jQuery, javascript, php, ajax calls. (consider)
